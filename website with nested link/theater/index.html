    introduction to theater
    Theatre or theater[a] is a collaborative form of performing art that uses live performers, usually actors or
    actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a
    stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song,
    music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the
    physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.[1] The specific place of the performance is also named by the
    word "theatre" as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, "a place for viewing"), itself from θεάομαι
    (theáomai, "to see", "to watch", "to observe")
